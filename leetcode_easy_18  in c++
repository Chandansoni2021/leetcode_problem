Code

class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(TreeNode* root) {
        // in this question basically in my word that we want to find the level of this binary tree.
        if(root==NULL){
            return 0;
        }
        else{
            return max(maxDepth(root->left),maxDepth(root->right))+1;
            // in this code we use recursion by above image you see that how it is work first we take left node then we can call a function itself to reach the base condition along with we take right node to check to reach the leaf node then we take max and add+1 because we could'nt take root node so we do this so we solve it ;
        }
    }
};
